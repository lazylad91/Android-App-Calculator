# Android-App-Calculator
## Some of the features pertaining to android :

Makes use of android development components like the LinearLayout, TextView and Buttons.
The app is responsive ( works in portrait as well as landscape mode) .
The app is designed to work even if the device is rotated
By default, when the screen is rotated the activity is killed and restarted. To make sure no data is lost, I've saved and restored the data using the lifecycle methods like "onSaveInstanceState" and "onRestoreInstanceState"
The results textview has a vertical scrollbar attached to it . This will help for user to view the results when the expression or the calculation result is too long to be displayed in the provided textview width.
